## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a replica of the theme that powers the "Inhabitent" website using Wordpress as a CMS. It should be fully compatible with content an admin may want to add to the website.

## Functionality
1. Admins should be able to freely add, update, and remove posts without changing the way the theme behaves. The theme will still be fully functionable with anything the admin may want to change.

2. The header will have a "light" and "dark" theme depending on what template is in use so that it is visible even on different backgrounds.

3. The search field in the header will extend or subtract as required. You can search the website for desired posts.

4. The ability to post comments on journal posts.
